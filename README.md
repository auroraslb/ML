# ML

This is the result of a team project in a machine learning class at IST Lisbon. Part of the objective was to explore different machine learning methods and different approaches to preprocessing the data.

The assignment consisted of four tasks, two regression tasks and two classification tasks.
Regression:
1. Train predictors given a training set of 100 samples.
2. Same as number 1, but with a certain percentage of the training samples being outliers.

Classification:
These tasks were both based on the UTKFace dataset.
1. This task was a binary classification task, predicting the gender of subjects.
2. This was a multiclass problem, identifying the ethnicity of the subjects.


In the "regression" folder, you'll find the necessary information and code for the regression problems.

In the "classification" folder, the code and information for the classification problems are available.

Installation guide:
1. Clone this git-repo to your computer
2. Create a virtual environment by calling the command "python3 -m venv virtual-env"
3. Activate the environment by calling "python3 -m venv virtual-env"
4. Install requirements for the project by calling "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
